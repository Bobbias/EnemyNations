This is released under a limited license:
1) No rights are given to the game Enemy Nations, the trademark Enemy Nations, or the concept.
2) Windward intends to someday create an Enemy Nations II and reserves all rights for all future versions of the game.
3) You may not sell anything derived from this code, art, or anything else included.
4) This is released solely for people to learn from the code and to make fixes in the existing code that they will make available for free.

If you don't like these restrictions, don't use this code/data.


Notes:

1) All files here are from backup CDs and should be everything needed.
2) enations_latest is the enations directory on my computer. So it "should" build correctly if it is copied over the enations directory.
3) This was built using the VC++ in release in 1990/91 - the one that came in the very big box.
4) My suggestion is build the code first (enations.exe and windward.dll) and use the existing enations.dat file.
   Then strip out the Windows 3.1 code, all drivers except TCP/IP from vdnplay, and the CD check code and test it runs.
   Then convert to the latest C++ and test it runs. Then you can start changing it.
5) To build the data (there may be steps I have forgotten):
   There is a macro in the xls file to convert the xls to the unit properties.
   There is a program to create an optimum 8-bit palette from the tga files.
   There is a program to convert the tga files to 8-bit. All graphics are in the dat file as both 24-bit and 8-bit.
   There is a program to create a riff file from all the individual data files.
