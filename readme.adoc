== Introduction

image::Enemy_Nations_cover.jpg[Enemy Nations Cover]

Released in 1996 by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Studios[Windward Studios], Enemy Nations is an RTS.
The premise of the story is that you, along with several other alien races, have discovered a planet to colonize, and
now you must all fight each other for the right to be the first to colonize this new planet.

The game was released as freeware in October 2005, and the game and source code was made available for download.

== Structure

The source code structure currently looks like this:

compress:: Source for a compression tool.
enations:: Source code from one source.
enations_latest:: mostly the same, but seems to be missing some parts.
makeriff:: A tool for assembling the final .dat file from the various components.
sprite:: A tool for working with the game's sprites.
src/cdf:: Another tool for building the final .dat file.
src/makeriff:: Duplication? of the makeriff source.
tools/lib:: Holds a bunch of lib files potentially necessary for building the final game and tooling.
tools/mss:: Headers and libs for the version of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Sound_System[Miles Sound System]
the game uses.
tools/smartheap:: A copy of the smartheap library the game uses. This copy was taken from the https://github.com/jedis/jediacademy[Jedi Academy source], and looks to be compatible.
tools/vdmplay:: A networking library that appears to be mostly in-house, although it makes use of both the Novell SDK
and a library by Rogue Wave.
tools/wing:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Nations[WinG], the graphics library which predates DirectX and provided
high performance graphics to early windows systems.

== Project Goals and Status

The ultimate goal of the project is to modernize the source code, and remove all outdated elements. This means removing
things like IPX networking, the CD requirement, and much more.

Currently I am working on getting everything to compile with relatively minimal changes.
