This is a multi-purpose disk so I can burn 1 CD for several different groups
of people. The contents are:

DEMO - Everything you need to create a site on your web page with a demo of
Enemy Nations. You can post this anywhere as long as you don't charge for
downloading it. You cannot put it on a CD or on a fee-based web site without
our specific permission.

MANUAL - The manual to Enemy Nations. You cannot use this without our express
permission.

SCREEN - Screen shots for Enemy Nations. These can be used to accompany any
article about Enemy Nations or on any web page about Enemy Nations without
asking for permission first. For any other use you need to ask first but we
will generally allow any reasonable usage.

WEB - Our web page. You cannot use this without our express permission.
