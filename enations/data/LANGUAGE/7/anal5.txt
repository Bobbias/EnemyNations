This is the second disk version of Enemy Nations and it has a number of limitations in it:
*)   This is a full featured game when playing a network game. These limits are only in single-player mode.
1)   Most game creation choices are limited to 1 selection.
2)   You can only research 10 items.
3)   You cannot build the most advanced units.
4)   You can only play the first 5 scenarios.
5)   In non-scenario play you can only play for 3 hours.
6)   You can save, but you cannot load a game. Saved games can be loaded in the retail version.
7)   You cannot create a multi-player game, you can only join.
