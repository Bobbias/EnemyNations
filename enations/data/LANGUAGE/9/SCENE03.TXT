Good work.  You have established the basis of a sustaining economy. However, it is not yet complete. Your mission, this turn, is to complete your economy with a Power Plant, Oil Well, and Refinery. You need to generate enough electricity for your economy and enough gas so that you are building up a surplus.

Also, your smelter was heavily damaged by another player. You must fully repair it to complete this mission.
