Currently :

View ( embedded in sprite ) :

int width, height of view
int bit depth of view
int anchor x ( may not be valid, but always present )
int anchor y ( may not be valid, but always present )
int number of hotspots
	for each hotspot
	int type	- 0 smoke/fire, 1 turret, 2 flag
	int x		- from UL corner of view
	int y

	overlay cnt .fb's - full size, half size, quarter size, eighth size
int anim1 cnt
	anim1 cnt .fb's - full size, half size, quarter size, eighth size
int anim2 cnt
	anim2 cnt .fb's - full size, half size, quarter size, eighth size

Format of .fb's depends on sprite type -
	Header is always
		char  id[ 2 ]
		short hold time
        short xoff
        short yoff
        short width
        short height
		int   image size
	Buildings are cropped and compressed .fb's
	Terrain is uncompressed with 8 levels of shading,
	so actual data is 8 times taller than the height given
	Vehicle is cropped but uncompressed

Sprite :

int type - type of sprite
int width, height - original ( uncropped ) width/height of sprite
int bit depth - 8, 15, 16, 24 ( 32 not yet implemented )
int view cnt
	Views

building - 12 stage x 4 dir x 4 dam int indicis of view or -1 for no view
